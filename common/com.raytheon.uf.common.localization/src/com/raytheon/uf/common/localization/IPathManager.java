/**
 * A generalized interface for getting ILocalizationFiles. Implementations
 * should enforce that there will only exist a single reference to any
 * ILocalizationFile per IPathManager instance. It is the IPathManager's
 * responsibility to ensure multiple objects representing the same
 * ILocalizationFile are not returned.
 * 
 * Paths passed as String arguments to methods should use IPathManager.SEPARATOR
 * as the separator for consistency. The client OS could potentially differ from
 * the localization store's OS, and this ensures the path will be resolved
 * correctly.

 * Apr 13, 2015 4383       dgilling    Added listStaticFiles, getStaticLocalizationFile
 *                                     and getStaticFile that searches based on
