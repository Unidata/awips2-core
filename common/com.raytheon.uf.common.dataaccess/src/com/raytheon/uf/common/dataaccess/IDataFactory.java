/**
 * Factory interface for producing data objects that implement IData, hiding the
 * details of the underlying data implementation object and how it was
 * retrieved.
 * 
 * Implementations of IDataFactory should strive to handle all their processing
 * based on the request interface that was received. If at all possible, they
 * should not cast the request to a specific request implementation, ensuring
 * that they will work with multiple request implementations.
 * 
 * The return types of the getData() methods should be geared towards returning
 * what a caller of the API would expect. For example, a request for county
 * polygons may not explicitly request that it wants the US state name as an
 * attribute on the returned object. However, a caller could reasonably expect
 * when requesting counties that the returned object includes state name. This
 * must be balanced carefully since a caller of the API does not see the factory
 * implementation but has expectations about what will be returned.
