    // in the depictable info table. If blank the default is left alone.
    // 2. The data that come from the virtual data server are multiplied by this
    // to get the display units. If this is a negative number then logarithmic
    // scaling will be used for the arrow lengths.
    // 3. This is the magnitude value, in display units, that is scaled to the
    // default length, which is 25 pixels times the character magnification. Two
    // values separated by a greater than sign will cause this to vary with the
    // vertical coordinate value. Presence of the item `log' in the rule
    // (delimited by commas like everything else) will cause this to vary with
    // the natural log of the vertical coordinate value.
    // 4. This is the magnitude value, in display units, that is the smallest
    // value for which to show an arrow. Defaults to zero.
    // 5. This is the magnitude value, in display units, that is the largest
    // value for which to show an arrow. Defaults to an arbitrarily large
    // number.
