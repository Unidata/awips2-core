/**
 * 
 * Create a specific number of Eclipse Jobs to handle tasks. This can be useful
 * if you have dozens or hundreds of tasks that each take a short time. Creating
 * a job for each task can result in more threads than is useful. If you instead
 * use a JobPool it reduces the number of threads by limiting the number of
 * eclipse jobs that are created. For many tasks a JobPool may perform faster
 * than using eclipse Jobs directly because thread creation and context
 * switching are reduced.
