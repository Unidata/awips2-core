# The request mode was designed to handle all requests from CAVE.  Therefore
# if services on another JVM failed, CAVE could still receive and send data.
# A few other services have crept in but this JVM mode remains relatively
# pristine.
#
# The creation of the Java class RequestRouter made it possible for CAVE code to
# easily send requests to other JVMs.
