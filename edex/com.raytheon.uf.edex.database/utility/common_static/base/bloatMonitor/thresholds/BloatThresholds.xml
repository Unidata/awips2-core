    This file is contains the default values for the bloat composition percentiles 
    for database tables at which both warnings and critical warnings will be 
    issued by Bloat Monitors.  Size is measured in megabytes.
    
    Site-level threshold files similar to this can be made, following the same
    format of size=<val> warningPercent=<val> criticalPercent=<val>.  Thresholds
    are defined by their size, so any number of thresholds may exist so long as each has a
    different size. While each threshold may have no more than one warning 
    percentile and one critical percentile, the values for those percentiles may
    be altered however it is seen fit (though the values must be from 1 to 100 
    inclusive, for obvious reasons). Also of note, threshold size is read in as a
    long and percentiles are read in as doubles. In order to completely override another 
    bloat threshold configuration file, the ID must be the same, and the priority must be 
    higher (default file priority is 0, numbers greater than that will have a higher priority, 
    negative numbers will have less priority), as the files are overridden in order of
    priority, highest to lowest.  Should it be desired to use a specific list of thresholds
    for only a certain database, schema, or table, add the requisite name of the item to
    its field in thresholdList ('.*' refers to 'all' items of that type).
    
    The 'database', 'schema', and 'table' fields are converted into RegEx statements, so multiple 
    possible overrides can exist for a single list. Example of overriding multiple 
    databases/schemas/tables with the same thresholdList:
    
        <thresholdList id="default" database=".*" schema=".*" table="r.*" priority="0">
        or 
        <thresholdList id="default" database=".*" schema=".*" table="(grid|grid_info)" priority="0">
    
    In order to "disable" or remove all warnings of bloat percent, an empty thresholdList can
    be made, and will apply to the corresponding specifications for the thresholdList.
    
    Please note, this is an incremental override file, indicating that files at different
    localization levels will be combined.
